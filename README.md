- The popular board game Blokus built in React.js
- This build currently only supports 4 players with plans to later introduce 2 and 3 player modes
- Built as a personal project as it is one of my favourite board games

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install` to download packages
3. Run `npm start` to start the server
4. Begin playing! 🎮

## 📝 Game Rules
- Starting from a corner, each player must place pieces on the board
- Each new piece must touch at least one other piece of the same color, but only at the corners
- The player with the highest score wins
- **Goal:** Fit as many of your pieces on the board as possible

## 🎮 How to Play (4-players)

#### Manipulating pieces
- Click and drag to move a shape
- Double-click a shape to rotate it 90 degrees clockwise
- Release the mouse over the board to place it

#### Playing the game
- **You must place your first piece so that it is touching the bottom left corner**
- If placed correctly, the turn will move to the next player
- When you cannot place any more pieces, press the "Give up" button to remove yourself from the game
- Once all players have given up, the winner will be announced, and the game will end
- Press "Restart Game" to start over

## 💻 Technologies Used
